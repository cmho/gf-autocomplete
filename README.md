# Gravity Forms Autocomplete

Adds options to Gravity Forms fields to turn on autocomplete and select a fill type (e.g. "email" or "cc-name") for accesibility purposes.

## Why should I use this?

Autocomplete helps users to better understand form inputs and fill them out more quickly with a minimum of fuss. This can be helpful for mobile phone users and people with a verity of disabilities, as well as just helpful from a lead generation perspective. 

## Installation

1. Either download the repository as a .zip from the Github repository, or `git clone` the repository to your Wordpress plugins folder.
2. Go to your Wordpress installation's plugin list and click "Activate" under "Gravity Forms Autocomplete."

Done!

## Usage

This plugin adds a dropdown to Gravity Forms fields under the "Advanced" tab, directly under the Admin Field Label field. Setting the field to "On" will have the browser make its best guess; otherwise, you can manually set the data type for the field to try and fill. MDN Web Docs has [a list of the autocomplete types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) with explanations for what they'll fill.
